Ever wanted to call in sick when you weren't? Need a really good excuse to be late or not come in at all? Well look no further than the repository of a former call center employee!This is the base code for the app "Call It In". There are (or will be) four functionalities to make getting out of your job easier! 

The first functionality is a Doctor's Note. Simply put in your name and answer some questions about you and your fake illness. Dr. BS will write you a great doctor's note.
